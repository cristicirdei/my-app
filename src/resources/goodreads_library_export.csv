I don’t know where this will go but I decided to give it a chance.</p><p>I am well aware of my subjectivity when praising this anthology but, then again, this is how we perceive Life.</p><p>One of my favourite subjects in literature (and beyond it) is people and human experiences. It is a real joy to catch glimpses of humans being humans -- the little things that we may try to hide, but that make us who we are. Being a silent observer of a show where I’m no longer the main character. And this has been one of the gifts of Flannery O’Connor’s prose: glimpses into the lives of people; strange people, gray people, mostly misfits (my favorite type), from an author with an uncanny grasp of the nuances of human behaviour. O’Connor doesn’t miss anything; the characters she writes are far from perfect, morally flawed, but real. They are you and me (though maybe a bit more), a mixed bag of good and bad, of quirks, longings, obsessions. Sometimes while reading these stories, one will have a hard time telling apart the victim from the villain. As a cartoonist also, she wrote her characters as she would draw them. The descriptions jump out of the page in the form of caricatures.</p><p>Set in the South (of the United States) the stories are written in the genre of Southern Gothic, a genre that I came to love. A sardonic sense of humour, which I adored, is sewn into these stories that are as funny as they are thought-provoking or straight-up weird.</p><p>As a devout Catholic, Flannery O’Connor wrote from a perspective of faith, touching on subjects of morality. Her stories address subjects such as racial integration, the Holocaust, and intersexuality. Issues of race come up often in her stories as do people with disabilities (as she herself was). Recurring motifs of farms, widowed women, sons with inclinations to be writers, and birds let one into the author's mind. </p><p>She wrote the most catchy and beautiful openings to her stories and the most surprising, allegorical, and often violent endings. The characters and situations she wrote about are the most creative, nonconforming, and weird ones I have encountered in my readings. <br/>There’s an elegance and beauty about O'Connor's writing. The sentences are a pleasure to read: picking words like flower petals she had carefully laid down a path.</p><p>The depth of these stories and their dense meaning is something I will explore for the years to come. They are the type of stories that don't give out everything on the first reading so you can be sure that at the second or third reading (or the hundredth) you will still find something surprising about them.</p><p>There is no measure of how much I love these stories or of the impression they left on me. I only know that I encountered something great. Flannery O'Connor's <i>The Complete Stories</i> is everything I love about stories and literature.</p>",,,1,0

Messy people. Strange people. Lonely people and misfits. <br/><br/>Somehow this theme has aligned itself with the works of <i>Carson McCullers</i> and <i>Flannery O'Connor</i>, and the genre of gothic. More precisely southern gothic. <br/><br/>A considerable number of books I've read this year were, coincidentally, set in the south of the United States. Besides the works of <i>Carson McCullers</i> and <i>Flannery O'Connor</i> (<i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i>, <i>The Ballad of the Sad Cafe</i>, and <i>The Complete Stories</i> respectively) I also read an emotional memoir, which I don't know how I stumbled upon but I am glad I did, of a man's journey away from his fundamentalist upbringing (the book that made me cry the most) and the journal of a journalist's quest through the Deep South to see for himself the struggles of African-Americans amid racial segregation.<br/><br/>Other nonfiction books I read this year include an overview of the earth's history and a very interesting book on the origins of language (rocks and words, two of my all-time interest –  readings on natural science are so fun)<br/><br/>I also read some classics such as <i>The Invisible Man</i>, <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, and <i>Animal Farm</i>. And poetry. My first time reading proper poetry on my own enterprise. <i>Brad Aaron Modlin</i> and <i>Pádraig Ó Tuama</i> are two of the poets that graced my readings. <br/><br/>Science fiction has made it on to the list again with the latest installment of an action-packed series I started in high school and <i>Ted Chiang</i>'s collections of short stories.<br/><br/>And talking about short stories, this has been the genre (apparently, I can call it that) that I enjoyed the most this year and has made a lasting impression on my taste in literature.<br/><br/>The gothic novel <i>The Devil All the Time</i> (which I devoured) and the-most-beautiful <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> (I couldn't imagine such a charming story could exist –  I'm a rational person and all but a word permeated by magic like Macando doesn't sound bad at all) count among the books read in 2022.<br/><br/> <p><blockquote>.  .  .</blockquote></p><br/><br/><b>Some conclusions</b> <br/><br/>I feel like this year I've been the most conscious and intentional with my readings and choices of books. I think it's safe to say that I've read the most beautiful literature of my life these past months and I hope this will be true in the years to follow as well.<br/><br/>I've also extended my horizons this year, discovering some gems along the way and starting to build my taste in literature, and I learned some things about myself (or at least had them brought to my attention), which is definitely a win.<br/><br/>In matter of books, this year has been a great one and I'm looking forward to the next one.<br/><br/> <p><blockquote>.  .  .</blockquote></p><br/>[bc:The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter|37380|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter|Carson McCullers|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385265834l/37380._SY75_.jpg|860196][bc:One Hundred Years of Solitude|320|One Hundred Years of Solitude|Gabriel García Márquez|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327881361l/320._SX50_.jpg|3295655][bc:The Complete Stories|25630779|The Complete Stories|Flannery O'Connor|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432988398l/25630779._SY75_.jpg|886814][bc:The Dawn of Language: Axes, Lies,Midwifery and How We Came to Talk|58874484|The Dawn of Language  Axes, Lies, Midwifery and How We Came to Talk|Sverker Johansson|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630157220l/58874484._SY75_.jpg|71244753] [bc:Everyone at This Party Has Two Names|31851874|Everyone at This Party Has Two Names|Brad Aaron Modlin|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479244671l/31851874._SY75_.jpg|52522532][bc:The Country Funeral|41713579|The Country Funeral|John McGahern|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1552103254l/41713579._SX50_.jpg|65061353][bc:A River in Egypt|41713584|A River in Egypt|David Means|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1552103388l/41713584._SX50_.jpg|65061357][bc:The Ballad of the Sad Café and Other Stories|45791|The Ballad of the Sad Café and Other Stories|Carson McCullers|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388247157l/45791._SY75_.jpg|952665][bc:Black Like Me|42603|Black Like Me|John Howard Griffin|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311696842l/42603._SY75_.jpg|2444552][bc:In the Shelter: Finding a Home in the World|23398580|In the Shelter  Finding a Home in the World|Pádraig Ó Tuama|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414558660l/23398580._SY75_.jpg|42955181][bc:Dark Age|29226553|Dark Age (Red Rising Saga, #5)|Pierce Brown|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525464420l/29226553._SY75_.jpg|49464237][bc:The Name of the Rose|119073|The Name of the Rose|Umberto Eco|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415375471l/119073._SY75_.jpg|3138328][bc:Întotdeauna diavolul|55260466|Întotdeauna diavolul|Donald Ray Pollock|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1599495800l/55260466._SY75_.jpg|15005760][bc:Lord of the Flies|55304668|Lord of the Flies|William Golding|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1599874805l/55304668._SY75_.jpg|2766512][bc:Where the Light Fell|56637947|Where the Light Fell|Philip Yancey|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617074089l/56637947._SX50_.jpg|88500928][bc:Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind|23692271|Sapiens  A Brief History of Humankind|Yuval Noah Harari|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1595674533l/23692271._SY75_.jpg|18962767][bc:A Little Life|22822858|A Little Life|Hanya Yanagihara|https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446469353l/22822858._SY75_.jpg|42375710]<br/>[a few of the books I enjoyed - <i>visible on the Desktop Version</i>]",,,2,0
