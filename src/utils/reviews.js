    review: `<p>I’m conflicted when writing about a book I really like because, on one hand, I could talk for hours about it, and on the other, I feel like my words won’t do justice so I refrain myself. I don’t know where this will go but I decided to give it a chance.</p><p>I am well aware of my subjectivity when praising this anthology but, then again, this is how we perceive Life.</p><p>One of my favourite subjects in literature (and beyond it) is people and human experiences. It is a real joy to catch glimpses of humans being humans -- the little things that we may try to hide, but that make us who we are. Being a silent observer of a show where I’m no longer the main character. And this has been one of the gifts of Flannery O’Connor’s prose: glimpses into the lives of people; strange people, gray people, mostly misfits (my favorite type), from an author with an uncanny grasp of the nuances of human behaviour. O’Connor doesn’t miss anything; the characters she writes are far from perfect, morally flawed, but real. They are you and me (though maybe a bit more), a mixed bag of good and bad, of quirks, longings, obsessions. Sometimes while reading these stories, one will have a hard time telling apart the victim from the villain. As a cartoonist also, she wrote her characters as she would draw them. The descriptions jump out of the page in the form of caricatures.</p><p>Set in the South (of the United States) the stories are written in the genre of Southern Gothic, a genre that I came to love. A sardonic sense of humour, which I adored, is sewn into these stories that are as funny as they are thought-provoking or straight-up weird.</p><p>As a devout Catholic, Flannery O’Connor wrote from a perspective of faith, touching on subjects of morality. Her stories address subjects such as racial integration, the Holocaust, and intersexuality. Issues of race come up often in her stories as do people with disabilities (as she herself was). Recurring motifs of farms, widowed women, sons with inclinations to be writers, and birds let one into the author's mind. </p><p>She wrote the most catchy and beautiful openings to her stories and the most surprising, allegorical, and often violent endings. The characters and situations she wrote about are the most creative, nonconforming, and weird ones I have encountered in my readings. 
There’s an elegance and beauty about O'Connor's writing. The sentences are a pleasure to read: picking words like flower petals she had carefully laid down a path.</p><p>The depth of these stories and their dense meaning is something I will explore for the years to come. They are the type of stories that don't give out everything on the first reading so you can be sure that at the second or third reading (or the hundredth) you will still find something surprising about them.</p><p>There is no measure of how much I love these stories or of the impression they left on me. I only know that I encountered something great. Flannery O'Connor's <i>The Complete Stories</i> is everything I love about stories and literature.</p>`,

    review: `<p>beautifully written, <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i> is a story about alienation, about finding one’s place in a world that seems to be made of a totally different material than one is made of, and about the longing for something, or someone, to make one feel listened to, feel seen, accepted, and loved.</p><p>i love this novel and i love its characters; a bunch of lonely misfits: a tomboyish girl who loves music, an alcoholic labor agitator, the owner of a diner, and an idealistic physician; all of them finding a confidant in the most unexpected listener, the deaf-mute Mr. Singer, who becomes their anchor into the world. the same man who’s also been left adrift by the separation from his friend:</p><blockquote>"The way I need you is a loneliness I cannot bear. [...] I am not meant to be alone and without you who understand"</blockquote></p><p>writes Mr. Singer in a letter to his friend, who is away in an insane asylum.</p><p>"you who understand" -- that is what Mr. Singer was to all these people; someone who understood them, or at least made it feel that way. and that is something we all want and need. 
    when i first wrote a few thoughts about this book, at the start of the year, i also added a quote that i considered to be appropriate:<blockquote>"We read books to know we are not alone" - William Nicholson</blockquote></p><p>maybe this is why i like this book so much. without knowing, Carson McCullers may have written me as well into this story.</p><p>Carson McCullers made it on to my favourite authors' list and <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i> is in my top 2 favourite books. i definitely need to re-read it and i might actually do it sooner than i thought. then i might be able to write something about it that is actually worthy of this book.</p>`,

    review: `i think i've just read the most beautiful thing written by man 

    the way that i love this book. from the first pages, i knew that it will enjoy it. 
    
    ghosts searching for water and company, flying carpets, yellow flowers raining from the sky, intoxicating beauty, obsessions of undoing for the sake of doing, and death. even death is curious in this enchanted world of Macondo. 
    
    <i>generations come and generations go. no one remembers people from long ago and all the people yet to come, they too will be forgotten by those that come after them</i> -- time runs. it is a spinning wheel bound to break <blockquote>' because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.'</blockquote> an act of injustice orchestrated by fate or an act of mercy. maybe amongst its many shapes and forms life is also a diamond; just spin it around and see its many faces. 
    
    i read this book marveling at its artistry and i now realize that i should re-read it with some different eyes and a different mind. i can't wait for time to circle back and start it afresh. until then -- magical realism -- i have my eyes on you.`,
